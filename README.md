# Library-DataBase

This is one of my first ever projects using JavaScript. It's a simple library app where you can add, view, and remove books. It uses local storage to save your data.

Features

- Add books with title, author, and pages
- Mark as read/unread
- Remove books
- Data persists with local storage
